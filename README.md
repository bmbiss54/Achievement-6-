# Career Foundry Final Project
We opensourced our own datasets to analyze, in which i selected a data set provided by Inside Airbnb on Listing Data from 2018. The Data set includes various information about the listings including the price, locations, listing details, and calendar data. I focused my analsys reviewing how the host pricing interacted with the elements in their listing such as the neighbourhood the listing resided, the ammenities and reviews the listing had so far. During the project I was able to increase my python scripting skills by performing data cleaning, wrangling, geographical plotting, correlation analysis, plotting of various types, cluster analysis, and time series regressions. Overall the project was very enjoyable and fun to do.
